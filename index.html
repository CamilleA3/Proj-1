    <p id="tribute-info" style="text-align: center"> Brief summary about Annie Easley</p>
  
  <p>Annie J. Easley was a computer scientist, mathematician, and rocket scientist who worked for the majority of her career at NASA. She worked in the Lewis Research Center (now Glenn Research Center) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). She was a leading member of the team which developed software for the Centaur rocket stage, and was one of the first Black women to work as a computer scientist at NASA. After high school, she went to Xavier University in New Orleans, Louisiana, and orignially majored in pharmacy for about two years. </p>

    In 1954, she returned to Birmingham. As part of the Jim Crow laws that established and maintained racial inequality, African Americans were required to pass an onerous literacy test and pay a poll tax in order to vote. She remembers the test giver looking at her application and saying only, "You went to Xavier University. Two dollars." Subsequently, she helped other African Americans prepare for the test. Her 34-year career included developing and implementing computer code that analyzed alternative power technologies, supported the Centaur high-energy upper rocket stage, determined solar, wind and energy projects, identified energy conversion systems and alternative systems to solve energy problems. Her energy assignments included studies to determine the life use of storage batteries, such as those used in electric utility vehicles. Her computer applications have been used to identify energy conversion systems that offer the improvement over commercially available technologies. She retired in 1989 (some sources say 1991).When Easley registered as a first-time voter, some restrictions did not allow Africans-Americans to register and vote. As one of them, Easley helped African-Americans to register and vote.

She studied battery-powered vehicles that work similarly to modern hybrid cars. When she worked with NASA, she worked on the launching of the shuttle that was used to measure ozone destruction. The software helped in testing and designing the NASA nuclear reactor.

In the 1970s, Easley returned to school to earn her degree in mathematics from Cleveland State, doing much of her coursework while also working full time. A firm believer in education and in her mother’s advice “You can be anything you want to be, but you have to work at it,” Easley was very dedicated in her outreach efforts at NASA. She not only participated in school tutoring programs but was a very active participant in the speaker’s bureau—telling students about NASA’s work and inspiring especially female and minority students to consider STEM careers.
